Kimberly's Portfolio 

About
- The purpose of this github page is to showcase my work and skills. I am currently a Data Science Master's student at Bellevue University with an anticipated graduation date of summer 2025. After completing my degree, I hope to obtain a job within the data science community that can help me learn and grow my skills even further.  I am based in the Denver Metro area and look forward to expanding connections in the area. If you have any questions or would like to reach out, you can find my contact informtaion below.
